# Deep Learning Basics with PyTorch 

### Based on the *upcoming* book by **Yves Hilpisch, Ph.D. — “Deep Learning with PyTorch” (O’Reilly, forthcoming)**

---

## Overview

This repository reproduces and extends exercises from the **pre-release draft** of *“Deep Learning with PyTorch”* by **Dr. Yves Hilpisch** (O’Reilly, forthcoming), applying the same workflows to real ADR market data to explore practical financial use cases.

Each notebook mirrors a **chapter** from the book and demonstrates how classical ML foundations evolve into deep learning within a **quantitative finance** context.

---

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to:

* Translate * Dr. Y. Hilpisch’s* pedagogical examples into **real-world financial data experiments**.
* Bridge the gap between **classical machine-learning intuition** and **deep-learning implementation** in quant research.
* Provide a transparent, reproducible workflow for ADR-based financial modeling.

## Dataset

All examples use **ADR (American Depositary Receipt)** data — for instance, ticker `CIB` — with engineered financial features:

* Daily and multi-day returns
* Rolling volatility
* Volume and volatility changes
* Binary targets (`1` = up day, `0` = down day)

These datasets replace synthetic ones such as `make_moons` or `iris`to create **realistic market-modeling challenges**.

## Environment Setup

### Create environment

```bash
conda create -n pytorch_dl python=3.12 -y
conda activate pytorch_dl
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels scipy numba jupyterlab notebook ipykernel -y
```

*(PyTorch will be added starting from Chapter 5.)*

### Launch Jupyter

```bash
conda activate pytorch_dl
jupyter lab
```
